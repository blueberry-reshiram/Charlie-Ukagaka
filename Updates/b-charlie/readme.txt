Hello!

Charlie is a simple and my very first ghost.
I first drew this little bean first as a random doodle in 2021 and now (2024) he ended up as this project.

Charlie is a little cutie you can pet and poke, as well as build a relationship with.
It's still just a simple one with little dialogue, but it may be expanded in the future.

I hope you can enjoy him, even if he may be rough around the edges.

For this, I used the Simplicity Template.
Art, dialogue and additional code are by me (unless otherwise specified). 

Huge shoutout to the people in the Discord server as they were a huge help.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to tell me!
You can find me on Discord (username blueberry_reshiram) and in the Ukagaka Dream Team servre.
