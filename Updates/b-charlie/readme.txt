Hello!

Charlie is a simple and my very first ghost.
I first drew this little bean first as a random doodle in 2021 and now (2024) he ended up as this project.

Charlie is a little cutie you can pet and poke.
I do intend to add more functions, such as a simple relationship system.

I hope you can enjoy him, even if he may be rough around the edges.

For this, I used the Simplicity Template.
Art, dialogue and additional code are by me (unless otherwise specified).
